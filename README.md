# Human Interface Guidelines

HIG is Autodesk's unified design system, so we can build better products faster.

## Implementations
Currently HIG has 2 implementations:
- Vanilla html/css/javascript, see [packages/vanilla](packages/vanilla)
- React, see [packages/react](packages/react)

## Design

HIG identifies 4 levels of detail in a UI:
- `Basics`: These are the most basic building blocks of the design: color, typography, icons, buttons, form elements, etc.
- `Components`: These are distinct pieces of the product experience, things like dialog boxes, navigation bars, toolbars and inspectors.
- `Page Types`: Think of these as specific types of views or screens within our products. This includes canvas views, list or grid indexes, dashboards and item details.
- `Mini-Experiences`: These are collections of components or pages that create a small, discrete experience within our products: sign-in, trial, sharing, in-product learning.
